nodemon will automatically refresh and restart the server everytime we make a change

"start": "node server.js" will start the server on a production environment without nodemon

controllers and routes are the same thing

index route is for when we don't have any resource or model in the URL

layout.ejs will have boilerplate HTML for every page of the application
